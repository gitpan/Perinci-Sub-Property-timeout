NAME
    Perinci::Sub::property::timeout - Specify function execution time limit

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     # in function metadata
     timeout => 5,

DESCRIPTION
    This property specifies function execution time limit, in seconds. The
    default is 0, which means unlimited.

    This property's wrapper implementation uses "alarm()" ("ualarm()"
    replacement, for subsecond granularity, will be considered upon demand).
    If limit is reached, a 504 (timeout) status is returned.
